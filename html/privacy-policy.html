        <h2>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h2>
        <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
        <p>When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise submit information, information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar data.</p>
        <p>They are processed, in particular, for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Ensuring a smooth connection setup for the website,</li>
        <li>Ensuring the smooth use of our website,</li>
        <li>Evaluating system security and stability, and</li>
        <li>Optimizing our website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is possibly evaluated statistically by us in an anonymized form to optimize our online presence and the underlying technology. </p>
        <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
        <p>The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>

        <p></p>
        <h3>Storage Duration:</h3>
        <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of collection. This is generally the case for data used to provide the website when the respective session is terminated. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Provision Required or Obligatory:</h3>
        <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, some services and features may not be available or restricted. Therefore, an objection is excluded. </p>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Contact Form</h2>
        <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>

        <h3>Legal Basis:</h3>
        <p>The processing of the data entered into the contact form is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>
        <p>By providing the contact form, we want to enable easy contact with you. The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing the request and for any follow-up questions.</p>

        <h3>Storage Duration:</h3>
        <p>Data is deleted no later than 6 months after processing the request.</p>
        <p>If a contractual relationship is established, we are subject to the statutory retention periods under the German Commercial Code (HGB) and delete your data after these periods have expired. </p>
        <h3>Provision Required or Obligatory:</h3>
        <p>The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only process your request if you provide us with your name, email address, and the reason for your inquiry.</p>

        <p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you that is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (data processing based on a balance of interests), including profiling based on that provision as defined in Art. 4(4) GDPR.</p>
        <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>
